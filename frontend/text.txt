So to make a react project we just have to write in the folder 

npm create vite@latest .

this command make the react file in the folder. 

and to run the react file we just have to write 

npm run dev



and so now after this i have installed axios 
so that is used in app.jsx for calling or fetching information thorugh internet
it gives us access to the http requests like get , post , put & delete



and now i am learning about CORS what does that mean and how it is used 
so basically CORS is somewhat giving permission who can access my server 


CORS means Safety of the server 
CORS means Cross Origin Resource Sharing

Cross origin means even if port number is changed then also there is a 
cross origin
different url is also considered as cross origin



the solution of the CORS issue is :-
1- Whitelist the url, portnumber that the user is using and then user can access backend
2- Make the server public , anyone can use it anytime just like api.github
we used to extract information about us
