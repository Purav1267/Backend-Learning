So to make a react project we just have to write in the folder 

npm create vite@latest .

this command make the react file in the folder.

. in the last make it to make the react file in the folder otherwise
without the use of . in the end it will make a another folder

and to run the react file we just have to write 

npm run dev



and so now after this i have installed axios 
so that is used in app.jsx for calling or fetching information thorugh internet
it gives us access to the http requests like get , post , put & delete



and now i am learning about CORS what does that mean and how it is used 
so basically CORS is somewhat giving permission who can access my server 


CORS means Safety of the server 
CORS means Cross Origin Resource Sharing

Cross origin means even if port number is changed then also there is a 
cross origin
different url is also considered as cross origin



the solution of the CORS issue is :-
1- Whitelist the url, portnumber that the user is using and then user can access backend
2- Make the server public , anyone can use it anytime just like api.github
we used to extract information about us

Without proxy

Frontend: http://localhost:5173

Backend: http://localhost:5000

If frontend code says:

fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/users")


‚Üí Browser sees you‚Äôre calling a different port ‚Üí CORS error (unless backend explicitly allows it).

üîπ With proxy (vite.config.js)
export default {
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:5000", // backend
        changeOrigin: true
      }
    }
  }
}


Now if frontend code says:

fetch("/api/users")


‚û°Ô∏è What happens:

Browser thinks you‚Äôre calling the same origin (http://localhost:5173/api/users). ‚úÖ No CORS error.

Vite dev server intercepts /api/....

Vite forwards it behind the scenes to http://localhost:5000/api/users.

Backend responds ‚Üí Vite passes it back ‚Üí frontend gets the response.

‚úÖ Effect

To the browser/frontend ‚Üí it looks like the request never left 5173.

To the backend ‚Üí it receives a normal request on 5000.

You avoided writing messy full URLs everywhere.

And no more CORS headache in dev.
